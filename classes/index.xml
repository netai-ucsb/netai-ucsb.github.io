      <description>Agenda In today&amp;rsquo;s class, we will discuss the paper, Requet: Real-Time QoE Detection for Encrypted YouTube Traffic.
First, we will go through the list of questions from your reading assignment. More specifically, we will learn about various stages of video streaming sessions and related QoE metrics. We will discuss the motivation and key insights from the paper before talking about its data-generation techniques, choice of machine learning model, and results.</description>

      <description>Agenda In today&amp;rsquo;s class, we will discuss the paper, The Road to SDN: An Intellectual History of Programmable Networks.
First, we will go through the list of questions from your reading assignment. I will then briefly describe Mininet, and how to use it for your research projects. I will then provide an overview of some of the recent trends in the area of software-defined networking.
The key learning objective for todayâ€™s class is to understand the intellectual history of SDN, how it enables network automation (which in turn enables self-driving networks), and get exposed to some of the latest trends in SDN.</description>

      <description>Agenda In today&amp;rsquo;s class, we will discuss the three articles related to self-driving networks and related research. These three articles are:
 Self-driving networks Measurements for self-driving networks An Effort to Democratize Networking Research in the Era of AI/ML  First, we will go through the list of questions from your reading assignment. I will then provide an overview of the other two articles, and we will then discuss the related questions as a group.</description>

      <description>Welcome Happy New Year!
Welcome to this special-topics course, AI/ML for Networked Systems.
Introductions In today&amp;rsquo;s class, we will spend some time learning more about each other. Please share:
 Which year of (under) graduate studies are you in at UCSB? What are your plans after graduation?
 What is your area of research (if any)? What problem are you working on these days (if any)?
 What motivated you to take this course?</description>
